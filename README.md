Just run

``` npm install ``` , ``` npm start ``` and ``` npm test ``` :)

If I had more time to spend on the coding challange I would:
1. finish implementing the "Favorite list"
2. use "redux hooks" or "redux-saga"
3. writing more detailed tests
4. focus more on app design and responsivness 
5. load all book authors details while loading the book details
